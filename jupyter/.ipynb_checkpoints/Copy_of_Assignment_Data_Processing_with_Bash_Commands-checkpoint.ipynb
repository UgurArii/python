        "4. Use the \"awk\" command to print only the first column of the dataset file (the sepal length).\n",
        "5. Use the \"grep\" command to filter the dataset file to only include rows where the species is \"versicolor\".\n",

        "7. Use the \"cut\" command to print only the first three columns of the sorted dataset.\n",

        "9. Use the \"head\" command to print the first 10 lines of the final dataset.\n",
        "10. Use the \"tar\" command to compress the \"data\" directory into a tarball called \"data.tar.gz\".\n",
        "11. Move the tarball into a new directory called \"backup\" in your home directory.\n",
        "12. Use the \"find\" command to search for all files in the \"backup\" directory that have been modified in the last 7 days.\n",
        "13. Use the \"diff\" command to compare the final dataset file in the \"data\" directory with the same file in the \"backup\" directory.\n",
        "14. Use the \"cmp\" command to compare the compressed tarball in the \"backup\" directory with the original \"data\" directory to ensure they are identical.\n",
